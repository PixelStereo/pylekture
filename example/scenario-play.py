Events might be index as root. Like this, we could refer in differents scenario the same event.
When saving an events, we save a reference to the events list : 
events as a protocol tyep (automatically detect when created), it is the class of the event

project[scenarios] => [SCENARIO_1, SCENARIO_2]

We should implement several class of Events
These class might be automatically detected and new_event method will create the appropriate class
- SCENARIO / EVENT
	- How to describe that we want to play an event or a scenaio which already exists?
	- PLAY
- OSC
	- if we have a / as first character
- WAIT
	- if we have a single float/integer (float is in seconds and integer in milliseconds)
- MIDI
	- if we have 3 numbers in a row (Channel btw 0/15, Controler btw 0/127 and Value btw 0/127)
	- we might create a sub-class for MidiNote, MidiCC, etcâ€¦
- PJLINK
	- if we have a command without ???
- UDP
	- send a raw UDP command
- OLA
	- a DMX command to be executed in python -> OLA
