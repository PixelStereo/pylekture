"""pylekture is a python package that provide an API to create scenario for intermedia projects.

The API is designed around the concept of a project, that handles scenario and outputs.
Each scenario contains events.

- Project: this is a bunch of Outputs and Scenario
- Output: This is frome here that you output Events
- Scenario:This is a bunch of Events
- Event:This is a command for a device, or a wait for the the Scenario


An output is associated to the project. But you can redirect each scenario to a different output
and even more. If an output is specified for an event, it will be use to output this event.
Even if it is different that the output associated with the parent scenario.

In details:
    - A project contains a list of Scenario and Outputs.
    - A scenario contains an ordered list of Events.
    - A scenario outputs its events to a choosen Output.
    - An output is a in/out protocol such as OSC, MIDI, Serial, Artnet etcâ€¦

Project has a few attributes:
    - version(read-only):the version of pylekture used to create this Project
    - lastopened:timestamp of the last time pylekture opened this file
    - created:timestamp of the creation of this file
    - autoplay:enable/disable play when file is loaded
    - loop:enable/disable play when project file reach ends of a play
