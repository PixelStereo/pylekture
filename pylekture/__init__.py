"""pylekture is a python package that provide an API to create scenario for intermedia projects.

The API is designed around the concept of a project, that handles scenario and outputs.
Each scenario contains events.

- Project: this is a bunch of Outputs and Scenario
- Output: This is frome here that you output Events
- Scenario:This is a bunch of Events
- Event:This is a command for a device, or a wait for the the Scenario


An output is associated to the project. But you can redirect each scenario to a different output
and even more. If an output is specified for an event, it will be use to output this event.
Even if it is different that the output associated with the parent scenario.

In details:
    - A project contains a Scenario, Events and Outputs.
    - A scenario contains an ordered list of Events.
    - An Event can conains Commands (Osc, Wait, MidiNote command)
    - Event, Scenario and Project can have wait, post_wait, loop
    - If the Comand have an output, it is used. If not, parent's output will be used.
    - An output is a in/out protocol such as OSC, MIDI, Serial, Artnet etcâ€¦

When creating a command, it will creates a parameter into a namespace dictionary.
This namespace file is not saved.

Namespace creation when loading a project
If Minuit protocol is used, namespace will be first asked to the device.
Update parameter settings if already exists
Scan all commands and create the parameter corresponding to
It is a reference, and will be saved through the namespace dictionary.

Project has a few attributes:
    - version(read-only):the version of pylekture used to create this Project
    - lastopened(read-only):timestamp of the last time pylekture opened this file
    - created:timestamp of the creation of this file
    - autoplay:enable/disable play when file is loaded

Project / Scenario / Event attributes:
    - loop:enable/disable play when project file reach ends of a play
    - wait:time in seconds to wait before start when triggered
    - post_wait:time in seconds to wait when finished before sending finish-message

- v0.3.1 - Aug. 8 2016
    - Fix output menu now display the right output in scenario & events tables
    - output 0 means "use parent" and output > 0 represents the index in the outputs list of the project
    - Fix OSC message without arguments
    - Fix events header

- v0.3 - Apr. 24 2016
    - Fix output hierarchy. parent is the default output. Project default output is the first one
    - redefine str() buildtin to unicode() for python 2
    - add export method to all nodes return a dict. Might be a json string in the future
    - all outputs now have a port attribute. Midi port for Midi, ip:udp for Udp
    - all events now have a command attribute which hosts the command of the event

- v0.2.2 - Apr. 19 2016
    - Massive Revamp
        - outputs is now attribute of project

        - remove all useless nodes called 'attributes' in the json export file
    - Revamp Output link to project / scenario / events
    - Revamp events. there is now a event.protocol value(OSC/MidiNote/PJLINK)
