"""
pylekture is a python package that provide an API to create scenario for intermedia projects.

The project is designed around the concept of a project, that handles scenario, 
which itself contains events.

An events can be a command or a wait for now, but we should extendending the concept
 later during the implementation.

In details : 
    - A project contains Scenario and Outputs.
        - A scenario contains an ordered list of Events.
        - A scenario outputs its events to a choosen Output.
        - An output is a in/out protocol such as OSC, MIDI, Serial, Artnet etcâ€¦

An output is associated to the project. But you can redirect each scenario to a different output
and even more.
If an output is given for an event, it will overwrite the scenario output for this event.
